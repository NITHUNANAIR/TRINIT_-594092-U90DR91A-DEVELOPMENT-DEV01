# TRI_NIT
# ngos

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook)

The major goal of this programme is to develop a single platform for NGOs and philanthropist. Its distinguishable donor and NGO dashboards detail the donations made to the relevant NGO and the funds received from the collaborative philanthropist, making it a standout feature.
