# TRI_NIT

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook)

The major goal of this programme is to develop a single platform for NGOs and philanthropist. Its distinguishable donor and NGO dashboards detail the donations made to the relevant NGO and the funds received from the collaborative philanthropist, making it a standout feature.

A clear idea of the functionality of this application will be provided by this demo. It features a donor's dashboard and a filter search for choosing the donor's appropriate area of interest. The donor is able to follow the funds they have given. In other words, the NGOs can inform the donor of how the money was spent.
