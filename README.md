A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

 Rooting for a good cause
 -------------------------
 
   Philanthropic groups invest their funds in advancing society. They must, however, be prepared to do so. On the other hand, regional non-profit organisations (NGOs) depend on funding from different donors. In order to have a beneficial impact on society, there is an increasing demand for a platform that can connect philanthropists and NGOs. Finding and supporting the proper cause might now be a time-consuming process with little information available about how funds are being used.

OBJECTIVES
-----------

--> Creating a centralised platform that makes it simple for donors to find and support NGOs working in causes close to their hearts is one of the project's main goals.
To give benefactors thorough details about each NGO, including their goals, background, and impact, to aid in their decision-making.

--> The major goal of this programme is to develop a single platform for NGOs and philanthropist. Its distinguishable donor and NGO dashboards detail the donations made to the relevant NGO and the funds received from the collaborative philanthropist, making it a standout feature.

--> To provide real-time updates on the usage of funds and the results of donations in order to increase openness and accountability in the donation process.

--> To give NGOs a means of expanding their audience and obtaining the resources they require to complete their goals.

--> To improve cooperation and communication between benefactors and NGOs in order to increase the effectiveness of their initiatives.

A clear idea of the functionality of this application will be provided by this demo. It features a donor's dashboard and a filter search for choosing the donor's appropriate area of interest. The donor is able to follow the funds they have given. In other words, the NGOs can inform the donor of how the money was spent.
